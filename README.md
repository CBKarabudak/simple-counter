# simple-counter

An counter that sticks to its simplicity, rather than being packed with features.

There is no installation, and usage is as simple as it gets.

Usage:

- Download the jar file from Releases (or compile Main.java) and run it.

- Type what number you want the counter to start from.

- A little number appears at the top of your screen. The counter will display on top of any other window on your computer.

    - Left click to increase the counter by one.

    - Right click to decrease the counter by one.

    - Middle mouse click to exit the counter.
