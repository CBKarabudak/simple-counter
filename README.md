# simple-counter
An always-on-top counter that sticks to its simplicity, rather than being packed with features.

So, one day I was playing RuneScape, and was frustrated by not knowing how many more planks I had to get to the Construction level I wanted. Being the nerd I am, I wanted a solution right then and there, so I opened up my compiler and coded away!

There is no installation, and usage is as simple as it gets.
1. Download the jar file(or compile the source yourself), and run it.
2. Type what number you want the counter to start from.
3. A little number appears at the top of your screen, and unfortunately is not moveable.

Left click to increase by one, right click to decrease by one, and click with your middle mouse button to quit the app. The window is always on top of other windows.
