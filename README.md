# simple-counter
An counter that sticks to its simplicity, rather than being packed with features.

There is no installation, and usage is as simple as it gets.

Installation:

- Download the jar file(or compile the source yourself), and run it.

- Type what number you want the counter to start from.

- A little number appears at the top of your screen. The counter will display on top of any other window on your computer.

Usage:

- Left click to increase the counter by one.

- Right click to decrease the counter by one.

- Middle mouse click when you're done with the counter.
