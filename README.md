# simple-counter
An always-on-top counter that sticks to its simplicity, rather than being packed with features.

So, one day I was playing video games, and needed a counter for a grindy task. Being the nerd I am, I wanted a solution right then and there, so I opened my IDE and went right at it.

The code does not have any comments, because it was meant for me to track my game stuff, but I figured I can't lose anything by sharing it.

There is no installation, and usage is as simple as it gets.

Installation:

- Download the jar file(or compile the source yourself), and run it.

- Type what number you want the counter to start from.

- A little number appears at the top of your screen.

Usage:

- Left click to increase the counter by one.

- Right click to decrease the counter by one.

- Middle mouse click when you're done with the counter.
